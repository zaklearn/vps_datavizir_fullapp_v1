## Module 5: Correlation Analysis

### Purpose
Examines relationships between different assessment variables to understand skill connections and develop integrated instructional approaches.

### Functionality
- Generates correlation matrix with interactive heatmap visualization
- Identifies statistically significant correlations (>|0.5|)
- Creates scatterplots with regression lines for selected variable pairs
