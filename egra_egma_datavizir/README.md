# Educational Assessment Analytics

## Overview

Educational Assessment Analytics is a comprehensive web application designed for analyzing Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) data. The platform enables educators, researchers, and policymakers to gain actionable insights from educational assessment data through interactive visualizations, statistical analyses, and detailed reports.

### 5. Correlation Analysis
Examines relationships between different assessment variables.

**Key Features:**
- Generates correlation matrix with interactive heatmap visualization
- Identifies significant correlations (>|0.5|)
- Creates interactive scatterplots with regression lines
- Provides educational interpretations of skill relationships

### 6. Test Reliability (Cronbach's Alpha)
Assesses internal consistency reliability of assessment instruments.

**Key Features:**
- Calculates Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for selected variables
- Interprets reliability levels with clear thresholds
- Visualizes reliability comparison across test groups
- Provides recommendations based on reliability analysis

### 7. Gender Effect Analysis
Examines performance differences between boys and girls.

**Key Features:**
- Compares mean scores by gender
- Tests statistical significance of gender differences
- Visualizes gender-based performance patterns
- Provides gender-responsive teaching recommendations

### 8. International Standards Comparison
Benchmarks local performance against established international standards.

**Key Features:**
- Compares local means with international benchmarks
- Calculates gaps and percentage of benchmark achieved
- Categorizes performance (critical, concerning, approaching, meeting)
- Provides recommendations based on benchmark comparison

## Extending the Application

### Adding a New Analysis Module
1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `analyse_new.py`)
2. Implement the main analysis function following the pattern in existing modules
3. Add the module to the `ANALYSES` dictionary in `main.py`
4. Create a corresponding report generator in the `report/` directory if needed

### Adding a New Language
1. Add the language to the `AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES` dictionary in `config.py`
2. Create a new translation dictionary in the `translations` variable

### Customizing Reports
Modify the report generator classes in the `report/` directory to change the format, content, or styling of the generated reports.
